# To Do list

## Hats

Please give the final complete code for the modified files

Please help me split _ into more files max 300 lines each

## Must

It should follow many differnet cripto currencies not only btc

It is still not frequent enough

Generating high frequency dashboard from 203 data points...
/Users/beborico/dev/crypto-trading-bot/trading/dashboard.py:166: FutureWarning: 'T' is deprecated and will be removed in a future version, please use 'min' instead.
  trade_freq = trans_df.resample('1T').size().reset_index()
/Users/beborico/dev/crypto-trading-bot/trading/dashboard.py:343: UserWarning: Tight layout not applied. The bottom and top margins cannot be made large enough to accommodate all Axes decorations.
  plt.tight_layout(rect=[0, 0.03, 1, 0.97])

modularize

Higher frecuency trading

Web UI

do a historical run mode to see how our model would have performed oer time

## 1. Risk Management Improvements

### Position Sizing

- Implement dynamic position sizing based on account equity and volatility
- Add percentage-based position sizing instead of fixed amounts

- Implement ATR-based stop-loss placement for volatility-adjusted exits
- Add time-based stop-loss (exit if trade doesn't move in expected direction within X time)

## 2. Strategy Enhancements

### Machine Learning Integration

- Add a machine learning module to predict price movements
- Implement sentiment analysis from news/social media to adjust trading decisions
- Create a hybrid approach combining traditional indicators with ML predictions

### Additional Strategies

- Implement mean-reversion strategies for ranging markets
- Add support for grid trading strategies
- Implement breakout detection for volatile markets

## 3. Backtesting and Optimization

### Comprehensive Backtesting

- Add a dedicated backtesting module to evaluate strategies on historical data
- Implement walk-forward analysis to reduce curve-fitting
- Add Monte Carlo simulations to better understand strategy robustness

### Parameter Optimization

- Implement genetic algorithms to optimize strategy parameters
- Add grid search capability for finding optimal parameter combinations
- Create adaptive parameters that change based on market conditions

## 4. User Interface Improvements

### Web Dashboard

- Create a web-based dashboard with real-time updates
- Add interactive charts with trade annotations
- Implement mobile-friendly interface for monitoring on the go

## 6. Performance Analytics

### Advanced Reporting

- Add detailed trade statistics (Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, drawdown analysis)
- Implement trade journaling with annotations

### Market Analysis

- Add market regime detection (trending/ranging/volatile)
- Implement correlation analysis with other assets
- Add volume profile analysis for better entry/exit points

## Done

It should do way higher frecuency trading and constantly update the user on the balance and all

How I feel like it should behave is that instead of like "Already in position - skipping buy" it should do like small enough trades that if he feels like the buying opportunity has increased since he bought he can double down on the bet maybe even fold a couple of times

make the trading more frecuent

Lets add colors to the terminal output
