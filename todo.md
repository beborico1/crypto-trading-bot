Please give the final complete code for the modified files

Please help me split _ into more files max 300 lines each

## Must

Do a new read me

Make dark mode

Storing and reading the data grom jsons is startin to prove problematic


Lets Improve way more the design ui/ux of the web interface I was thinking purple tones a very cool ui / ux

For the models when starting a new bot it should also be a select instead of a text input

The graphic is broken we can see one it does not fit in the container it has more height than the container but most importantly it showing 1 increases starting in 0 every time it refreshes which make no sense it should show like 100 constantly instead when is has not yet traded anything

The graphic is still now showing the right data

Build an Awesome Web UI

Higher frecuency trading

It should follow many differnet cripto currencies not only btc

It should do way higher frecuency trading and constantly update the user on the balance and all

How I feel like it should behave is that instead of like "Already in position - skipping buy" it should do like small enough trades that if he feels like the buying opportunity has increased since he bought he can double down on the bet maybe even fold a couple of times

make the trading more frecuent

Lets add colors to the terminal output
